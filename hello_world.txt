n the realm of code, a novice begins,
Syntax whispers, a dance that wins.
Errors teach, each bug a guide,
In this coding journey, courage resides.

Brackets talk, in a language profound,
A coder's adventure, logic unbound.
Embrace the challenge, with each keystroke,
In the world of code, dreams evoke.
